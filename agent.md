# agent.md — Weekly Schedule System (Current State)

This repo is a doctors/clinicians scheduling system with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend + OR-Tools solver. It is local-first and stores state in SQLite via the API.

---

## Quick Start for New Agents
Where to look first
- UI logic + state: `src/pages/WeeklySchedulePage.tsx`
- Grid rendering + drag/drop: `src/components/schedule/ScheduleGrid.tsx`
- Template builder (Settings → Weekly Calendar Template): `src/components/schedule/WeeklyTemplateBuilder.tsx`
- Shared calendar layout helpers (main/public/print): `src/lib/calendarView.ts`
- Slot/template normalization + row building: `src/lib/shiftRows.ts`
- Rendered assignment map + pool logic + overlaps: `src/lib/schedule.ts`
- Backend normalization + persistence: `backend/state.py`, `backend/db.py`
- Solver: `backend/solver.py`
- E2E tests + diagnostics: `e2e/fixtures.ts`, `e2e/app.spec.ts`, `e2e/colband-explosion.spec.ts`
- API client: `src/api/client.ts`
- Settings UI: `src/components/schedule/SettingsView.tsx`

Where to verify behavior
- UI rules, drag/drop, overlaps: `src/components/schedule/ScheduleGrid.tsx`, `src/lib/schedule.ts`
- Template/slot migration: `src/lib/shiftRows.ts` and `backend/state.py`
- Solver constraints: `backend/solver.py`
- Public/published views: `src/pages/PublicWeekPage.tsx`, `backend/web.py`
  - Public + print routes use the same calendar layout helpers as the main view (`src/lib/calendarView.ts`).

- Auth: python-jose (JWT), passlib (password hashing)

---

## 2) Core UI
Top bar
- Title is clickable and returns to calendar view.
- Button order (left → right): Settings, Help, Theme toggle, User avatar.
- Settings/Help buttons turn into a highlighted **Back** state when active.
- Open slots badge lives in the schedule card header (green when all slots filled).
- Responsive: stacks on small screens; avatar row moves below the main controls.

Schedule card
- Week navigator lives inside the card header; range label uses DD.MM.YYYY (or DD.MM.YYYY – DD.MM.YYYY); Today button sits next to the arrows.
- **Week picker**: clicking on the date range label opens a custom calendar popover (not the native browser picker). The calendar displays weeks as selectable rows—hovering highlights the entire week, and clicking any day navigates to the Monday of that week. A small calendar icon appears next to the date label. "Select a week" hint text and a "This week" button are included. Click-outside detection closes the picker.
- On mobile, the schedule renders a single day with a day navigator (label between arrows, Today next to them).
- Today is shown by circling the day number in the header.
- Week starts Monday; weekend/holiday styling is header-only: weekend header light gray, holiday header light lavender; holiday name is a tiny purple label under the day.
- Mobile: grid uses touch scrolling and slightly tighter paddings.
- Calendar grid should not scroll vertically; it expands and the page scrolls. Horizontal scrolling remains.
- Automated shift planning and Export are separate panels in the schedule view; Export panel opens the same modal as before.
- Vacation Planner panel sits between Automated Shift Planning and Export; it opens the full-screen Vacation Overview.
- Control row between section rows and pool rows with icon buttons:
  - Only necessary, Distribute all, Reset to free (week and per day), with tooltips.
- Week publication uses a **Publish** toggle pill in the header, placed to the right of the Open Slots badge.
- Rule violations badge sits next to Open Slots only when violations exist; click to see details and highlight the related pills (red).
- Split shifts badge: shows count of non-consecutive shifts (gaps between assignments for the same clinician on the same day). Hover badge to highlight all split shift pills; hover/click individual items in the popover to highlight specific pills with connection lines (same red styling as rule violations).

Rows
- Sections are stored as class rows (MRI, CT, Sonography, On Call, etc.) and are selected inside template blocks (no separate section/shift panel).
- Calendar view groups template slots by location + row band (one row per row band with at least one placed slot); row labels show the row label centered with the location name directly beneath it.
- Per day, additional sub-columns appear for day columns that have slots; header shows `Col N` for extra columns, and pool rows render only in the first column per day.
- Pool rows (editable names, not deletable): Rest Day (id: pool-rest-day), Vacation (id: pool-vacation).
- **Deprecated pools (removed)**: Distribution Pool (pool-not-allocated) and Reserve Pool (pool-manual) were removed. State normalization automatically removes these rows and any assignments to them on load.
- Pool rows appear below a separator line.
- Row labels are uppercase, no colored dots, truncate around 20 characters (tighter on mobile).
- Vacation row background stays the same gray even on weekends/holidays.

Cells
- Each active class cell shows a small panel with the section name and time at the top; open slots and assignments render inside that panel.
- Multiple clinician pills per cell, sorted by surname.
- Empty slots shown as gray dashed pills based on the template required count per day type (fallback to legacy min slots); plus/minus badges are gray; label is not bold.
- Drag and drop is same-day only; invalid drops (wrong day or outside the grid) snap back instantly.
- Drag/drop does not block rule-violating placements (same-day location mix, multiple shifts); solver enforces rules but manual overrides are allowed and shown in red. Overlap within the same day is blocked by drag/drop (uses time intervals).
- Drag-to-remove: dragging a clinician pill outside the grid removes the assignment.
- Dragging into or out of Vacation updates the clinician vacation ranges.
- Clinician Picker: clicking an open slot shows a popover with eligible clinicians; warnings show "Already in slot" (priority) or "Not qualified".
- Eligible target cells for a dragged clinician use a pale green background (consistent with the green "Open Slots" badge when count is 0).
- Ineligible manual assignment is allowed, with a yellow warning icon.
- No eligible sections shows a red warning icon.
- Warning tooltips show only when hovering the icon itself.
- Hovering a section cell highlights eligible clinicians for that section on the same date (desktop only); highlight stays when hovering a pill and is cleared while dragging.

Pills
- Compact blue pill, normal font weight; eligible hover highlight uses green background + green border (no extra thickness).
- Name abbreviation: if a clinician's name doesn't fit, it is progressively abbreviated ("First Last" → "F. Last" → "F. L." → "FL"); full name shown on hover. Disambiguates when siblings would collide (e.g., "Da. Truhn" vs "D. Turner").
- Warning icons are small circular badges at top-right of the pill.
- Drag preview uses the normal pill style (highlight removed).
- Assignment pills show only the name; time is shown in the section block header or the column header (when consistent).
- Distribution Pool pills show only the remaining free time segments.
- Rule-violation pills render in red automatically.
- While dragging a clinician, all other pills for the same clinician on the same day turn darker blue with a black outline; the dragged pill uses the same style.
- Smoke test (API): `API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8000 ADMIN_USERNAME=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=<pass> node scripts/smoke-api.mjs`

## 3) Settings
Section Blocks (Weekly Calendar Template)
- Section blocks are just section names; time, end-day offset, and required slots are set per placed slot in the grid.
- Add block by name; delete via the small x in the block list (no clone/gear).
- Drag blocks into the grid or click an empty cell to add; placed blocks can be dragged to move.
- Empty grid cells show "Drop a block or click to add a block."
- Multiple shifts are represented by multiple blocks (no sub-shift editor).

Weekly Calendar Template
- Single calendar with locations stacked; day-type columns are shared across locations (Mon..Sun + Holiday).
- Per-day columns: add columns for a specific day; delete via a hover-only "Delete Column" button at the top of the first row (confirm only if the column has slots).
- Delete button highlighting: hovering Delete Location/Row/Column buttons shows a thick red outline around the entire group (not per-cell rings). The outline uses edge borders only—top/left/right/bottom borders on the outer cells of the highlighted region.
- Row bands are simple rows with an editable row label in the left header cell; Add row is a full-width dashed button below each location; row delete confirms only if the row has slots.
- Section blocks sidebar stays visible while scrolling the template grid (sticky at all sizes; scrolls with the template grid container).
- Blocks live in `weeklyTemplate.blocks` and slots reference `blockId`.
- Slots define time range, end-day offset, and required slots (single value); blocks carry only the section reference.
- Holiday day type always overrides weekdays at runtime (no fallback).
- Settings views that use section dropdowns (solver on-call rest, clinician eligible sections) are filtered to sections that exist as current template blocks.
- Copy Day: button in template builder copies all columns and slots from one day type to another; requires confirmation checkbox if target has existing content.

Locations
- Manage locations inside the calendar template (top-left "+ Location" button).
- Location order uses a dropdown; names are edited inline.
- Delete location (confirm) is allowed even for the default location; the next location becomes the new default (`loc-default`) and slot locationIds are updated.

Pools
- Rename pool rows (Rest Day, Vacation). No deletion.
- **Deprecated pools (removed)**: Distribution Pool (`pool-not-allocated`) and Reserve Pool (`pool-manual`) were removed from the UI. State normalization automatically removes these rows and any assignments to them on load.
- Rest Day pool is used to park clinicians before/after on-call duty when the setting is enabled.
- Pool visibility is a UI filter only: class assignments are never hidden by rest-day/vacation logic.
- If a clinician is marked off on a date, any pool assignment for that date is re-routed to the Rest Day pool in the UI (so they stay visible).

Slots / Template integrity
- Invalid slot assignments are repaired on load:
  - If a slot references a block/section that no longer exists or the slot dayType does not match the assignment date's dayType, the assignment is removed (since Distribution Pool was deprecated).
  - This is enforced in both frontend normalization (`src/lib/shiftRows.ts`) and backend normalization (`backend/state.py`).
- ColBand explosion safeguard: max 50 colBands per day type (MAX_COLBANDS_PER_DAY). If exceeded, extra colBands are blocked and logged. Safeguard is enforced in:
  - `src/lib/shiftRows.ts` (normalizeTemplateColBands)
  - `src/components/schedule/WeeklyTemplateBuilder.tsx` (sanitizeLocations)
  - `src/pages/WeeklySchedulePage.tsx` (setWeeklyTemplate wrapper blocks saves over 500 total colBands)
- **Slot collision detection**: Multiple sections sharing the same `rowBandId + dayType + colBandOrder` causes only one section to be visible in the calendar UI while others are hidden but still exist in the database. This is a critical configuration error.
  - Detection: `slotCollisions` useMemo in `WeeklySchedulePage.tsx` identifies collisions by grouping classShiftRows by `locationId__rowBandId__dayType__colBandOrder` and flagging groups with multiple different `sectionId` values.
  - Warning banner: A prominent red banner appears below the top bar when collisions are detected, showing:
    - Error title: "Template Configuration Error: Hidden Sections Detected"
    - Explanation of the issue (only one section visible, others hidden)
    - Expandable list of collision details (day type, row band, affected section names)
    - "Open Settings" button to navigate to template builder for fixing
  - Fix: Ensure each section has its own row band in the Weekly Template Builder.

Clinicians
- List with Add Clinician and Edit buttons (Add uses a dashed, full-width button below the list).
- Editing uses the same modal as clicking a pill in the calendar.
- Optional working hours per week field (contract hours).

Clinician Editor (modal)
- Panel order: Eligible Sections → Vacations → Preferred Working Times.
- Eligible sections list is ordered. Drag to set priority (this order is also the preference list).
- Add eligible sections via dropdown + Add button; remove via per-row Remove button.
- Vacation management uses custom date pickers (DD.MM.YYYY format) with calendar dropdown; setting a start date after the current end date auto-adjusts end to start + 1 day.
- Invalid date ranges (end before start) show red styling with "End must be after start" warning but are allowed for editing flexibility.
- Past vacations collapsed in a <details>.
- Modal body is scrollable for long vacation lists.
- Preferred working times persist per clinician as `preferredWorkingTimes` (mon..sun with startTime/endTime + requirement none/preference/mandatory).
- Mandatory windows are hard solver constraints; preference windows add a small solver reward.
- Week solver nudges total assigned minutes toward `workingHoursPerWeek` within the tolerance (manual assignments count toward totals).
- Per-clinician working hours tolerance: stored as `clinician.workingHoursToleranceHours` (default 5 hours). Each clinician can have a different tolerance for how much their assigned hours can deviate from their contract hours.

Working Hours Overview
- Dashboard panel opens a full-screen modal showing yearly working hours for all clinicians.
- Year selector with navigation buttons; "Today" button jumps to current year/week.
- Each clinician shows: name, contract hours (e.g., "40h/w"), weekly hours worked, yearly total.
- If contract hours are set, also shows: Expected (fractional for partial weeks), Difference, Cumulative.
- Weeks span Jan 1 to Dec 31 with partial weeks at year boundaries (e.g., if Jan 1 is Thursday, first week has 4 days).
- Expected hours for partial weeks are calculated as `expectedWeeklyHours * (daysInWeek / 7)`.
- Color coding: emerald (within ±2h of expected), amber (under by >2h), rose (over by >2h).
- Pool assignments (rest day, vacation) do not count toward working hours.
- Slot duration comes from the weekly template; defaults to 8 hours if not set.
- Current week is highlighted with sky-blue background; sticky header + Total column.

Holidays
- Year selector with stepper buttons.
- Country picker with flag emoji (top EU countries + CH, LU), alphabetical.
- "Load Holidays" fetches from https://date.nager.at/api/v3/PublicHolidays.
- Add holidays manually; list shows DD.MM.YYYY dates (input accepts DD.MM.YYYY or ISO).
- Add Holiday button is a dashed, full-width button below the list and opens an inline add panel.
- Holidays behave like weekends in solver + min slot logic and show in the calendar header.

Solver Settings
- Toggle: Enforce same location per day (default: enabled).
- Toggle: Prefer continuous shifts (default: enabled). When enabled, the solver prefers assigning adjacent time slots (where one slot's end time equals another's start time, same location) to the same clinician, creating continuous work blocks rather than fragmented schedules.
- Multiple shifts per day are always allowed (removed setting); only actual time overlaps are blocked.
- On-call rest days: toggle + section selector + days before/after. When enabled, solver enforces rest days and the UI places clinicians into the Rest Day pool.
- On-call rest days dropdown only shows sections that exist as current template section blocks.
- Working hours tolerance is now per-clinician (see Clinician Editor); removed from global solver settings.
- Rule violations are evaluated for the current week and surfaced in the header badge; affected pills are shown in red.
- Violations include: rest-day conflicts, same-day location mismatches (when enforced), and overlapping shift times.
- **Click-to-scroll for violations**: Clicking a rule violation in the popover scrolls the schedule grid to show the responsible assignment pill (smooth scroll to center).
- **Click-to-scroll for split shifts**: Clicking a split shift item in the popover scrolls to and highlights the relevant pills with connection lines.
- Automated planning runs the week solver over the selected date range in one call and shows an ETA based on the last run's per-day duration.
- **Optimization weights**: Collapsible section in the Solver Info modal (gear icon) allows configuring objective weights:
  - Coverage (1000), Slack (1000), Total Assignments (100), Slot Priority (10), Time Window (5), Gap Penalty (50), Section Preference (1), Working Hours (1).
  - "Total Assignments" and "Slot Priority" are only active in "Distribute All" mode (visually dimmed with amber description).
  - Each weight has an info tooltip explaining its effect in layman's terms.
  - "Reset to defaults" button restores all weights to their default values.

Testing
- Frontend unit/component tests: Vitest + Testing Library (`npm run test` runs `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` only).
- Backend tests: pytest (dev deps in `backend/requirements-dev.txt`), run `python3 -m pytest backend/tests`.
- E2E tests: Playwright specs in `e2e/` (`npm run test:e2e`).
  - Uses API login and seeds `localStorage.authToken`.
  - Resets state before each test and restores original state after the suite.
  - Env: `E2E_USERNAME`, `E2E_PASSWORD`, `PLAYWRIGHT_API_URL`, `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`.
  - Defaults to `testuser` / `sdjhfl34-wfsdfwsd2` when `E2E_USERNAME`/`E2E_PASSWORD` are unset.
  - `test:e2e` script includes `PLAYWRIGHT_HOST_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE=mac15-arm64` for Apple Silicon.
  - Default non-admin test user for local E2E: `testuser` / `sdjhfl34-wfsdfwsd2` (set `ENABLE_E2E_TEST_USER=0` to disable creation, do not use in production).
  - In sandboxed runs, Playwright may need escalated permissions to access `localhost:8000` and launch Chromium (otherwise EPERM/permission-denied errors).
  - Diagnostics on failure: console, page errors, failed requests, >=400 responses, screenshot, HTML snapshot, and trace (see `e2e/fixtures.ts`).
  - PDF export test calls `/v1/pdf/week` and asserts the generated PDF has exactly one page.
  - Print layout test opens `/print/week` in print media and asserts the scaled schedule fits within one A4 page (portrait or landscape) and fills at least 70% of one dimension.
  - ColBand explosion tests (`e2e/colband-explosion.spec.ts`): verify colBand counts stay stable through settings, Copy Day, column operations, and solver runs; checks for console explosion errors.
  - Pool removal tests (`e2e/pool-removal.spec.ts`): verify deprecated pools (Distribution Pool, Reserve Pool) are not rendered while Rest Day and Vacation pools remain visible.
  - Full workflow test (`e2e/full-workflow.spec.ts`): UI-only comprehensive test that simulates a user setting up a schedule from scratch:
    - **Step 1**: Login as admin (`admin` / `tE7vcYMzC7ycXXV234s`)
    - **Step 2**: Create test user `test` with password `test` via User Management UI
    - **Step 3**: Logout from admin
    - **Step 4**: Login as test user
    - **Step 5**: Create section blocks via Settings → Weekly Calendar Template:
      - 6 sections: MRI, CT, Sonography, X-Ray, On-Call, Emergency
    - **Step 6**: Create 3 locations: Berlin, Aachen, Munich
    - **Step 7**: Create 7 clinicians with unique names (includes test run ID to avoid duplicates)
    - **Step 8**: Return to calendar view
    - **Step 9**: Run automated solver ("Apply Solution" when found)
    - **Step 10**: Verify assignments exist in calendar
    - **Step 11**: Navigate weeks forward
    - **Step 12**: Final verification and logout
    - Takes screenshots at each step (saved to `test-results/` directory)
    - Uses unique clinician names per test run to avoid selector issues with duplicates
    - Timeout: 3 minutes
    - Run with: `ADMIN_USERNAME=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=tE7vcYMzC7ycXXV234s PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 npx playwright test e2e/full-workflow.spec.ts`
    - View results: `npx playwright show-report`
    - **Note**: Eligibility assignment step is currently skipped - clinicians inherit eligibilities from the template. For full eligibility testing, see the eligibility helpers in the test file.

Dev server restart
- Kill existing servers via `lsof -nP -iTCP:8000 -sTCP:LISTEN` and `lsof -nP -iTCP:5173 -sTCP:LISTEN`, then `kill <pid>`.
- Start backend: `python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 > logs/dev-backend.log 2>&1 &`
- Start frontend: `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173 > logs/dev-frontend.log 2>&1 &`
- In this sandbox, use `setopt NO_BG_NICE` when starting background jobs to avoid `nice(5) failed` errors.
- Health checks from within the sandbox can fail with “Operation not permitted”; verify from the browser instead.
- Reason: background jobs may be auto-niced; the sandbox blocks `nice(5)`, so disable background niceness before launching servers.

Vacation Overview
- Open via the Vacation Planner panel in the main schedule view.
- Full-screen year grid: clinicians as rows, day numbers across the year, month headers span their days.
- Grey bar per clinician; green segments for vacation ranges (clipped to the selected year).
- A thin vertical Today marker appears only when viewing the current year.
- Multi-year timeline: year row stays visible and updates as you scroll; there is a "Today" jump button.
- Clicking a clinician row opens the Clinician Editor modal scrolled to vacations.

Admin user management
- User export: admin can download a user state JSON (export includes metadata + AppState).
- User import: create user form accepts an export JSON to seed the new user's state.

iCal (download + subscription feed)
- The Export panel button opens a modal:
  - Primary tabs: **PDF**, **iCal**, **Web**.
  - iCal has a secondary toggle for **Subscription** (default) vs **Download**.
  - Subscriptions include **only weeks marked Published** in the schedule view (week toggle above the grid).

PDF export (server-side, Playwright)
- Print-only routes:
  - `/print/week?start=YYYY-MM-DD`
  - `/print/weeks?start=YYYY-MM-DD&weeks=N` (multiple pages in one PDF)
- Print pages (`src/pages/PrintWeekPage.tsx`, `src/pages/PrintWeeksPage.tsx`) scale the full schedule table to fit one A4 landscape page using a fixed 6mm margin + safety factor; multi-week export waits for each page layout before `__PDF_READY__`.
- Backend endpoints:
  - `GET /v1/pdf/week?start=YYYY-MM-DD` (single week)
  - `GET /v1/pdf/weeks?start=YYYY-MM-DD&weeks=N` (combined PDF)
- PDF render specifics:
  - Always A4 landscape with background colors.
  - Content is top-aligned and horizontally centered within the printable area.
  - Auto-scale to fit the full table on the page (never scales up above 1x).
  - Margins are 6mm on all sides.
  - Multi-week export uses the max width/height across all `.print-page` grids.
  - Open Slots badge, Publish toggle, and Open Slot pills are hidden in PDF.
- The print route sets `window.__PDF_READY__ = true` after data loads + two rAFs; backend waits for that signal.
- Export UI:
  - PDF tab accepts start week + number of weeks (max 55).
  - User can choose **one combined PDF** or **individual files**.
- Env var `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` is used by the backend to reach the frontend for PDF rendering:
  - Domain setup: `https://$DOMAIN`
  - IP-only setup: `http://SERVER_IP`
- Print CSS lives in `src/index.css` (`print-color-adjust`, overflow visible, no-print elements hidden).

iCal download (frontend-only)
- Supports:
  - "All clinicians" (one `.ics` file containing many events across many dates)
  - Individual clinician `.ics` files
  - A date range filter (Start/End) shown/entered as `DD.MM.YYYY` (empty = all dates)
- Implementation details:
  - Only section assignments are exported (pool rows are ignored).
  - Events are all-day (`DTSTART;VALUE=DATE` / `DTEND;VALUE=DATE` with end = +1 day).
  - Range parsing accepts `DD.MM.YYYY` (and also `YYYY-MM-DD`), swaps Start/End if reversed, and disables download on invalid input.
- Files: `src/lib/ical.ts`, `src/components/schedule/IcalExportModal.tsx`, wiring in `src/pages/WeeklySchedulePage.tsx`.

Subscribable iCal feed (cryptic URL)
- Publication scope is controlled by `publishedWeekStartISOs` in user state:
  - Array of Monday ISO strings (YYYY-MM-DD) for weeks that are released.
  - If empty, the feed is valid but has **zero** events.
- Backend stores tokens in SQLite:
  - `ical_publications` (one token per user, all clinicians).
  - `ical_clinician_publications` (one token per clinician per user).
- Public endpoint (no JWT): `GET /v1/ical/{token}.ics`
  - Returns `text/calendar; charset=utf-8`
  - Only section assignments are included (pool rows ignored)
  - Only weeks listed in `publishedWeekStartISOs` are included
  - Clinician tokens return only that clinician’s assignments
  - Vacation override is applied: assignments are skipped on days where the clinician is on vacation (the UI hides these too, but raw assignments can remain in persisted state).
  - Bug fix: clinician-specific feeds must not reuse/overwrite the `clinician_id` filter variable in `backend/ical.py`; otherwise every link returns the last clinician’s events.

Known issues / fixes
- ICS clinician filter bug: avoid shadowing `clinician_id` in `backend/ical.py` (use a different loop variable for clinicians). Symptom was that every clinician link returned the same clinician’s events.
  - All-day events; UID is stable (`assignment.id@shiftschedule`) so clients update instead of duplicating
  - HTTP caching: sets `ETag` + `Last-Modified` and supports conditional GET (returns 304 when unchanged)
- Authenticated endpoints (JWT required):
  - `GET /v1/ical/publish` (status, includes all + per-clinician URLs when published)
  - `POST /v1/ical/publish` (enable links; keeps existing tokens)
  - `POST /v1/ical/publish/rotate` (new tokens for all + clinicians; old URLs become 404)
  - `DELETE /v1/ical/publish` (unpublish; URL becomes 404)
- Subscription UI behavior:
  - Status is a **Links active** toggle; turning it off unpublishes.
  - **Refresh links** rotates tokens after confirmation.
  - All clinicians link is shown in the same list as individual clinicians.
  - Links are auto-refreshed when the Export modal opens (no separate “Update links” button).
- Subscribe URL base:
  - Backend uses env var `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` if set (recommended for production behind HTTPS). For the domain+Caddy setup in this repo (backend behind `/api`), set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://$DOMAIN/api`.
  - Otherwise it falls back to `request.base_url` (works for local dev).
- Local verification:
  - Publish via UI, then `curl -i "<subscribeUrl>"` should return 200 + calendar data.
  - Re-run with `If-None-Match` or `If-Modified-Since` should return 304 if unchanged.
  - Note: Many real calendar clients (especially Apple Calendar on devices) strongly prefer HTTPS for subscriptions.

Public web view (share link)
- Public route: `/public/:token?start=YYYY-MM-DD` (no login).
- Backend table: `web_publications` (one token per user; rotation invalidates old link).
- Auth endpoints:
  - `GET /v1/web/publish` (status)
  - `POST /v1/web/publish` (enable)
  - `POST /v1/web/publish/rotate` (new token)
  - `DELETE /v1/web/publish` (disable)
- Public data endpoint: `GET /v1/web/{token}/week?start=YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Returns `published:false` if the week is not in `publishedWeekStartISOs`.
  - When published: returns rows, clinicians, assignments (section rows only, within week), min slots, slot overrides, holidays.
  - Vacation override is applied (assignments hidden on vacation days).
  - HTTP caching: `ETag` + `Last-Modified` with conditional 304.
- Export modal → **Web** tab:
  - Links active toggle, refresh link (confirm), copyable public URL.
  - URL uses `${window.location.origin}/public/<token>`.
  - If a week is unpublished, the public page shows “This week is not published yet.” but keeps navigation visible.

Hover highlight issue (remote)
- Root cause: pills had both blue and emerald classes at once; Tailwind CSS order kept the blue background even when `isHighlighted` was true.
- Fix: use mutually exclusive class sets in `AssignmentPill` so emerald styles fully replace blue.
- Symptom: cell hover worked but pills did not turn green; fixed after frontend rebuild.

Hover stuck after drag (local/remote)
- Root cause: CSS `:hover` (group-hover) sometimes stays active after a drag cancel, leaving ghost slots or cell backgrounds stuck.
- Fix: drive ghost slot visibility and cell hover background from `hoveredClassCell` state instead of CSS hover.

Drag preview styling
- Drag image uses a cloned pill; if it was highlighted, the clone kept emerald classes.
- Fix: strip all emerald classes on clone and re-apply the normal blue classes during drag start.

Slot override key parsing
- `slotOverridesByKey` keys are `slotId__dateISO` (e.g., `slot-1__2026-01-05`).
- Backend validates date portion; malformed keys with day types instead of dates (e.g., `slot-1__mon`) are skipped.

ColBand explosion on fresh start (fixed)
- Root cause: In `backend/state.py` `_normalize_weekly_template()`, the legacy migration check used `not getattr(template, "blocks", None)` which evaluates to `True` for an empty list `[]` because empty lists are falsy in Python.
- Symptom: Fresh databases started with 50 colBands per day (hitting the safeguard limit) instead of 8 (one per dayType).
- Mechanism: The faulty check triggered legacy migration for v4 templates with empty blocks. Legacy migration treats each existing colBand as a "legacy" colBand and creates 8 new colBands (one per dayType) for each, resulting in 8×8=64 colBands.
- Fix: Changed the condition from `not getattr(template, "blocks", None)` to `not hasattr(template, "blocks")` which correctly checks for property existence rather than truthiness.
- Note: The frontend (`src/lib/shiftRows.ts`) was already correct, using `!("blocks" in template)` which checks property existence.

Code patterns to avoid
- **Double `.get()` calls**: Avoid calling `.get()` twice on the same key; cache the result instead.
  - Bad: `d.get(k).attr if d.get(k) else None`
  - Good: `v = d.get(k); v.attr if v else None`
- **setTimeout without cleanup**: Always store timeout IDs and clear them in useEffect cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
  - Bad: `setTimeout(() => ref.current?.focus(), 0);`
  - Good: `const id = setTimeout(...); return () => clearTimeout(id);`
- **Duplicate functions**: Avoid creating multiple functions with identical implementations; consolidate them.
- **Test assumptions**: Tests should not assume default state has data; always create required test fixtures explicitly.

  weightSectionPreference?: number;  // default 1
  weightWorkingHours?: number;       // default 1
};
```

Slot IDs
- Section assignments use TemplateSlot ids (Assignment.rowId = TemplateSlot.id); pool rows continue using their plain pool IDs.
- Default template generation uses legacy shiftRowId values (`classId::subShiftId`, e.g. `mri::s1`) for slot ids so existing assignments survive.
- UI uses “section”, but internal ids and RowKind still use `class` for compatibility.

---

## 5) Scheduling Logic (Frontend)
- Vacation override: for each date, if clinician is on vacation, they appear in Vacation pool and their section assignment is suppressed.
- Multiple shifts per day are always allowed; time overlap detection prevents assigning the same clinician to overlapping shift intervals.
- Rest Day Pool (pool-rest-day): if on-call rest days are enabled, clinicians assigned to the on-call section are placed into Rest Day on the configured days before/after (fallback to Reserve if Rest Day is missing).
- Assignments stored in a map (rowId + dateISO -> list of assignments); section rows use template slot ids.
- Drag and drop only within the same day; manual overrides are allowed even if they violate solver rules.
- Clicking a section slot cell increments the per-day slot override for that slot id (adds an "Open Slot"); remove via the minus badge.
- Day type is `holiday` if the date is in holidays; otherwise it is the weekday. Holiday settings always override weekday settings.
- Overlap checks use time intervals (start/end + endDayOffset); shift order is not used for overlap decisions. These checks feed solver constraints and UI violation detection.
- Drag/drop also prevents placing a clinician into overlapping time slots on the same day.
- Clinician picker popover: viewport-aware positioning opens above anchor when insufficient space below (flips direction automatically).

---

## 6) Solver (Backend, OR-Tools)
Endpoints:
- `POST /v1/solve` (single day)
- `POST /v1/solve/range` (range solver; accepts `startISO` and optional `endISO`)
Payloads:
```json
{ "dateISO": "YYYY-MM-DD", "only_fill_required": true|false }
```
```json
{ "startISO": "YYYY-MM-DD", "only_fill_required": true|false }
```

Behavior
- Day solver (`/v1/solve`) uses only clinicians in Distribution Pool (unassigned + not on vacation).
- Range solver (`/v1/solve/range`) considers all clinicians not on vacation; manual assignments are treated as fixed.
- Range solves include a 1-day context window on both ends for rest-day constraints; rest rules only enforce inside the selected range and emit a warning note if boundary days are already assigned.
- Hard constraints:
  - Qualification required.
  - Vacation overrides assignment.
  - Manual assignments remain in place; solver adds additional assignments as needed.
  - Overlap checks use time intervals (start/end + endDayOffset), not shift order.
  - Multiple shifts per day are allowed as long as they don't overlap in time.
  - "Enforce same location per day" blocks mixing locations on the same day.
  - On-call rest days: if enabled, clinicians assigned to the selected on-call section must be unassigned on the configured days before/after.
- Targets template slot ids; order weights follow location order + row band order + column band order.
- Qualification + preference checks use slot.sectionId (the parent section).
- Objective:
  - Prioritize coverage by section order (top of section list is highest).
  - Minimize missing required slots.
  - If `only_fill_required=false`, add extras using wave-based distribution.
  - Preferred sections (order of eligible sections) is a lower-weight tie breaker.
  - Gap penalty (when preferContinuousShifts enabled): penalizes non-adjacent shifts on the same day; weight (`weightGapPenalty`, default 50) encourages continuous work blocks.
- Wave-based equal distribution (when `only_fill_required=false`):
  - First fills all slots to 1× their base required count.
  - Then fills all slots to 2× their base required count.
  - Then 3×, 4×, etc. until clinicians are exhausted.
  - Wave multiplier is calculated as `total_available_clinicians // total_base_required`.
  - Ensures proportional distribution across slots instead of piling all extras into high-priority slots.

Performance optimizations:
- Constraint building uses O(n) date-based grouping instead of O(n²) pairwise comparisons.
- Lookup tables: `vars_by_clinician_date`, `vars_by_date_slot`, `manual_count_by_date_slot`.
- Model build time ~25s for 100+ day ranges (down from ~100s before optimization).

Debug mode (development only):
- Set `DEBUG_SOLVER=true` environment variable to enable detailed timing instrumentation.
- When enabled, each solve writes a JSON file to `backend/logs/solver_debug/` with:
  - Checkpoint timings for each major step (load_state, date_setup, slot_contexts, create_variables, overlap_constraints, coverage_constraints, on_call_rest_days, working_hours_constraints, continuous_shift_constraints, objective_setup, solve, result_extraction).
  - State summary (clinician count, location count, assignments, etc.).
  - Model statistics (num_variables, solver status, objective value).
  - Result info (assignments created, slack remaining).
- **Production warning**: Do NOT deploy with `DEBUG_SOLVER=true`. Remove or unset the environment variable for production builds. The debug logs consume disk space and may impact performance.
- Files are named `solve_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_microseconds.json` for easy identification.
- Frontend debug panel: When DEBUG_SOLVER is enabled, the solver response includes `debugInfo` which the frontend displays in the solver notice modal:
  - Summary stats: solver status, variable count, days, slots, solutions found, improvement percentage.
  - Objective value chart: SVG line chart showing objective value (Y-axis) vs. time in seconds (X-axis) for each solution found during the solve.
  - Timing breakdown table: shows each phase name, time (ms/s), percentage of total, and a visual bar chart.
  - Component: `SolverDebugPanel.tsx` renders the debug visualization.

Timeouts:
- All ranges: 60s (flat timeout regardless of range size)

Week-by-week fallback:
- If full-range solver fails for >14 day ranges, automatically retries solving each week individually.
- Each week uses 60s timeout.
- Returns partial results if some weeks succeed and others fail.
- Notes include timing info for each week solved.

Solver notice panel (frontend):
- Displays timing info (build + solve time) on success and failure.
- Stays open until user clicks to dismiss (click backdrop or X button).
- Centered modal with scrollable content for long diagnostics.

Subprocess architecture (force abort):
- Solver runs in a separate subprocess using `multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")`.
- Main process spawns `_solver_subprocess_worker` which runs the actual CP-SAT solving.
- Progress is relayed via `multiprocessing.Queue` from subprocess to main process, then broadcast to SSE subscribers.
- Abort endpoint (`POST /v1/solve/abort`) supports two modes:
  - Default: Sets cancel event flag, solver stops at next solution callback (graceful).
  - `force=true`: Immediately terminates the subprocess via `Process.terminate()` then `Process.kill()` if needed.
- This enables instant abort even when the solver is stuck without finding new solutions.
- Global tracking: `_solver_process` holds the subprocess reference, `_solver_cancel_event` for graceful abort.
- Subprocess cleanup: `atexit` handler and aggressive cleanup function (`_cleanup_solver_process`) ensure subprocesses are killed on backend restart/crash. Uses `terminate()` first, then `kill()` after 2s timeout.

SSE live updates (real-time progress):
- Endpoint: `GET /v1/solve/progress?token=<jwt>` (Server-Sent Events stream).
- Events:
  - `connected`: Initial connection confirmation.
  - `start`: Solver started with `{startISO, endISO, timeout_seconds}`.
  - `solution`: New solution found with `{solution_num, time_ms, objective, assignments}`.
  - `complete`: Solver finished with `{startISO, endISO, status, error?}`.
- Solution events include full assignments array, allowing the frontend to apply intermediate solutions.
- Frontend subscribes via `subscribeSolverProgress()` in `src/api/client.ts`.
- When aborted, the last solution's assignments can be applied immediately.

Solver overlay (SolverOverlay.tsx):
- Renders inside the calendar container via `createPortal(content, calendarContainer)` where `calendarContainer` is the parent of `.calendar-scroll`.
- Uses absolute positioning (`absolute inset-0 z-30`) so it only covers the calendar area.
- Only shows when the displayed week overlaps with the solve range.
- Compact panel width (`w-auto max-w-lg`) that fits content.
- Components:
  - Animated spinner with indigo accent.
  - Date range label (DD.MM.YYYY format).
  - Preparation phase indicator: shows current solver phase before first solution (e.g., "Loading schedule data...", "Solving constraints...").
  - Live solution chart: SVG line chart showing objective value over time (log scale, inverted so better scores appear higher).
  - Elapsed/total time counter (X:XX / Y:XX format, e.g., "0:45 / 1:00").
  - Action buttons:
    - "Abort" (rose/red) - always visible, discards any solutions found.
    - "Apply Solution" (indigo/blue) - only shown after solutions found, applies current best solution.
    - "Details" button - opens full-screen dashboard with all graphs.
- Full-screen dashboard (SolverDashboard):
  - Opens via "Details" button, renders as full-viewport overlay via portal to `document.body` (z-[1100]).
  - Shows all graphs: Score, Filled Slots, Non-consecutive Shifts, People-Weeks within Working Hours, Location Changes.
  - Live updates continue while dashboard is open.
  - "← Back" button to close and return to compact overlay.
- Solver stats calculation: modular function in `src/lib/solverStats.ts` (`calculateSolverLiveStats`).
- Stats include both solver-generated and existing manual assignments in the solve range for accurate filled slots display.
- Stats tracked: filledSlots, totalRequiredSlots, openSlots, nonConsecutiveShifts, peopleWeeksWithinHours, totalPeopleWeeksWithTarget, locationChanges.

Automated Shift Planning panel (frontend):
- Timeframe: "Current week" and "Today" quick buttons; custom date pickers (DD.MM.YYYY) for start/end displayed inline with dash separator.
- Strategy: "Fill open slots" (only fills required slots) or "Distribute all" (assigns all available clinicians).
- Run button triggers solver.
- Reset button opens a dropdown panel with two options:
  - "Reset Solver Only": Removes only assignments created by the automated planner (source === "solver"); keeps manual assignments.
  - "Reset All": Removes all assignments in the selected timeframe, including both manual and solver-generated ones.
- Reset panel auto-positions: opens above the button when there's insufficient space below (viewport-aware).

Custom date picker component (`CustomDatePicker.tsx`):
- European format (DD.MM.YYYY) with calendar dropdown.
- Calendar shows month navigation, weekday headers (Mo-Su), today highlight, selected date highlight.
- Dropdown opens above if not enough space below (auto-detects).
- Fixed width 252px for consistent dropdown size; z-index 100 for proper layering.

## 7) Backend State + Persistence
Backend stores one JSON blob per user in SQLite:
```json
{
  "locations": [{ "id": "loc-default", "name": "Default" }],
  "locationsEnabled": true,
  "rows": [...],
  "clinicians": [...],
  "assignments": [...],
  "minSlotsByRowId": {...},
  "solverSettings": {
    "enforceSameLocationPerDay": true,
    "onCallRestEnabled": false,
    "onCallRestClassId": "on-call",
    "onCallRestDaysBefore": 1,
    "onCallRestDaysAfter": 1,
    "preferContinuousShifts": true
  },
  "solverRules": [],
  "publishedWeekStartISOs": ["2025-12-22"],
  "holidayCountry": "DE",
  "holidayYear": 2025,
  "holidays": [{ "dateISO": "2025-12-25", "name": "Christmas Day" }]
}
```
Note: `solverRules` is legacy and not used by the current UI/solver, but remains in state for compatibility.
`weeklyTemplate` (v4) is stored alongside the state and is the source of truth for schedule rows; `slotOverridesByKey` keys are `slotId__dateISO`.
State normalization on load
- Ensures `locations` exists (adds loc-default).
- Ensures section rows have `locationId` and `subShifts` (defaults to 08:00–16:00, endDayOffset 0).
- `locationsEnabled` is legacy; if false in older data, normalization forces default location usage and sets it back to true.
- Generates/normalizes `weeklyTemplate` v4; if missing, builds a default template from sections + sub-shifts (slot ids use legacy shiftRowIds).
- Filters assignments + slot overrides to existing template slot ids (and pool rows).
- Template slot assignment ids (e.g. `slot-1`) are preserved during normalization in both frontend and backend.
- Ensures `solverSettings` defaults, clamps on-call rest day values, and fixes invalid on-call class ids.
- Ensures the Rest Day pool exists (pool-rest-day), inserted after Reserve Pool.

Default state (clean database)
- Default state is loaded from `backend/default_state.json` file.
- New users start with a pre-configured radiology department setup:
  - **Location**: Berlin
  - **Sections**: On Call, MRI, CT, Sonography, MRI Neuro, CT Neuro (+ Rest Day, Vacation pools)
  - **Clinicians**: 2 sample clinicians (Galileo Galilei, Leonardo DaVinci) with full qualifications
  - **Weekly Template**: 4 row bands (MRI, CT, Sonography, On call), 3 columns per weekday, 2 columns for weekends/holidays
  - **Slots**: Pre-configured with times (08:00-12:00, 12:00-16:00, 16:00-08:00+1d for on-call)
  - **Holidays**: German holidays for 2026
- To modify the default state, edit `backend/default_state.json` directly.
- Fallback: if the JSON file doesn't exist, an empty state with only Rest Day and Vacation pools is created.
Table: `app_state` (id = username). Legacy row id `"state"` is migrated to `"jk"`. The table now also has an `updated_at` column which is bumped on every `POST /v1/state` save.

Endpoints
- `GET /health`
- `POST /auth/login`
- `GET /auth/me`
- `GET /auth/users` (admin only)
- `GET /auth/users/{username}/export` (admin only)
- `POST /auth/users` (admin only, seeds new user with default state from `default_state.json`)
- `PATCH /auth/users/{username}` (admin only, supports password reset)
- `DELETE /auth/users/{username}` (admin only)
- `GET /v1/state`
- `POST /v1/state`
- `POST /v1/solve`
- `POST /v1/solve/range`
- `POST /v1/solve/abort` (abort solver; `?force=true` kills subprocess immediately)
- `GET /v1/solve/progress` (SSE stream for live solver updates; requires `?token=<jwt>`)
- `GET /v1/ical/publish`
- `POST /v1/ical/publish`
- `POST /v1/ical/publish/rotate`
- `DELETE /v1/ical/publish`
- `GET /v1/ical/{token}.ics` (public, no JWT)

---

## 8) Auth Model (Backend + Frontend)
- JWT auth; frontend stores token in `localStorage` key `authToken`.
- Admin user is created on startup if `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` are set and the user does not already exist.
- Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD_RESET=true` to force-reset the admin password on startup (useful for local dev DBs).
- Creating a user in the admin panel seeds the new user with the default state from `backend/default_state.json` (not the admin's state).
- Login is case-sensitive (`admin` is lowercase).
- Login screen includes show/hide password toggle.

---

## 9) Running Locally (Step-by-step)
Prereqs
- Python 3.9+
- Node 18+

**Quick start (Claude Code agent)**
To start fresh with a clean database:
```bash
# Kill any existing processes
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null

# Delete database for fresh start (optional)
rm /Users/danieltruhn/Workspace/ShiftSchedule/schedule.db

# Start backend (env vars inline - IMPORTANT: must be on same line or exported first)
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=tE7vcYMzC7ycXXV234s JWT_SECRET=change-me-too python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &

# Start frontend
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173 &
```
- Default admin credentials: `admin` / `tE7vcYMzC7ycXXV234s`
- Database location: `/Users/danieltruhn/Workspace/ShiftSchedule/schedule.db` (project root, not `backend/`)

**Common pitfalls**
1. **Admin password mismatch**: The admin user is created on first backend startup with the password from `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. If you delete the database and restart with a different password, or if the database already exists with a different password, login will fail.
   - Fix: Delete the database file and restart the backend with the correct password.
   - The password is hashed on user creation; changing `ADMIN_PASSWORD` after the user exists does NOT update the password.
   - Use `ADMIN_PASSWORD_RESET=true` to force-reset an existing admin password.

2. **Env vars not passed to backend**: If you start the backend without the env vars on the same command line (or without exporting them first), the admin user won't be created or will use wrong defaults.
   - Wrong: `python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app ...` (no env vars)
   - Right: `ADMIN_USERNAME=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=tE7vcYMzC7ycXXV234s python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app ...`

3. **Database location**: The database is at project root (`schedule.db`), not `backend/schedule.db`.

Auth env (required for login):
```bash
export ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export ADMIN_PASSWORD=tE7vcYMzC7ycXXV234s   # local dev password
export JWT_SECRET=change-me-too
```

Step 1: install backend deps
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

Step 2: install frontend deps
```bash
npm install
```

Step 3: start backend (Terminal 1)
```bash
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=tE7vcYMzC7ycXXV234s JWT_SECRET=change-me-too python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Step 4: start frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
```

Step 5: open the app
- http://localhost:5173
- Login: `admin` / `tE7vcYMzC7ycXXV234s`

Codex CLI sandbox note (local dev)
- You may see `operation not permitted` when binding to ports (8000/5173) if the sandbox disallows it.
- Fix: rerun the start commands with escalated permissions, or use a Python `subprocess.Popen(..., start_new_session=True)` wrapper to launch in the background.
- Also avoid `nohup` in this environment; it can trigger permission errors.

If a port is already in use
- The backend has a startup check that errors if port 8000 is already in use, with a message like: "Port 8000 is already in use by another process."
- Kill existing processes: `lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9` and `lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9`
- Backend: pick another port, then set `VITE_API_URL` for the frontend:
```bash
python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host localhost --port 8001
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8001 npm run dev -- --host localhost --port 5173
```
- Frontend: pick another port with `--port 5175` and open that URL in the browser.

If the UI says "Solver service is not responding"
- Check backend health: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Ensure `VITE_API_URL` matches the backend host/port.
- If backend logs show 401 on `/v1/solve`, the auth token is invalid (often after a JWT secret change). Log out/in.
- If backend logs show a validation error for `solverSettings` fields, restart the backend so the updated models load.
- If using a non-localhost host (LAN or remote), set CORS explicitly:
```bash
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=http://my-host:5173 python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Env note
- `export ...` in a terminal is session-only (not permanent).

Stopping servers
- Press Ctrl+C in each terminal, or `lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9` / `lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9`.

Deployment note
- Build the frontend with `VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.example.com npm run build`, then serve `dist/`.
- Run the backend behind a reverse proxy (or public host) and set `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` to your frontend origin.

---

## 10) UI Styling
Centralized button styles
- All button styles are defined in `src/lib/buttonStyles.ts` for consistency.
- `pillToggle` / `getPillToggleClasses(isActive)`: toggle buttons with sky-blue active state.
- `buttonPrimary`: main action buttons (Save, Close, Run).
- `buttonSecondary`: secondary actions (Cancel, Reset, Today).
- `buttonSmall`: inline action buttons (Edit, Remove in lists).
- `buttonDanger`: destructive actions (Remove with rose color).
- `buttonAdd`: dashed border add buttons (Add Person, Add Holiday).
- `pillLabel`: non-interactive label pills.
- When adding new buttons, use these centralized styles instead of inline classes.

---

## 12) Notes for New Agents
- The calendar is the source of truth for edits; Settings manages section priority + min slots + pool names + clinician list.
- Pool ids: Distribution Pool = `pool-not-allocated`, Reserve Pool = `pool-manual`, Rest Day = `pool-rest-day`, Vacation = `pool-vacation`.
- Keep drag restricted to same day; manual overrides are allowed even if they violate solver rules.
- Mobile single-day view uses `useMediaQuery("(max-width: 640px)")` with `displayDays`; week-level calculations still use `fullWeekDays`.
- `ScheduleGrid` supports variable day counts (dynamic `gridTemplateColumns`, last column determined by index).
- Hover highlighting is desktop-only (no hover on mobile) and uses `AssignmentPill` `isHighlighted`.
- HTML5 drag-and-drop does not work on mobile; touch DnD would require a new library or alternate UX.
- If you change the solver API, update `src/api/client.ts` and `WeeklySchedulePage.tsx`.
- Legacy row id `pool-not-working` is filtered out on load.

---

## 13) Current Hetzner Deployment (Domain, default)
- Server IP: `46.224.114.183`
- SSH user: `root`
- Path: `/opt/shiftschedule`
- Stack: `docker compose up -d --build` (uses `docker-compose.yml` + Caddy).
- Frontend: `https://shiftplanner.wunderwerk.ai`
- Backend: `https://shiftplanner.wunderwerk.ai/api`
- Data lives in the `backend_data` volume; you can update only the frontend without touching the DB.
- Typical frontend update: rsync repo to `/opt/shiftschedule`, then `docker compose build frontend` and `up -d frontend`.

### Remote setup checklist (smooth deploy)
- Ensure `/opt/shiftschedule/.env` exists before running compose. If you use `rsync --delete`, exclude `.env` or recreate it after sync.
- Required `.env` values for domain setup:
  - `DOMAIN=shiftplanner.wunderwerk.ai`
  - `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=daniel.truhn@gmail.com`
  - `ADMIN_USERNAME=admin`
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=tE7vcYMzC7ycXXV234s`
  - `JWT_SECRET=change-me-too`
  - `JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES=720` (avoid empty string; backend crashes on startup)
- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set in `docker-compose.yml` as `https://${DOMAIN}/api` (don’t leave it blank).
- If login fails and you need a forced reset, set `ADMIN_PASSWORD_RESET=true` in `.env` and restart backend, then remove/disable it after login works.
- iCal subscription endpoints require `/api` proxying in the frontend nginx config; otherwise `/api/v1/ical/*.ics` returns HTML and Apple Calendar rejects it.
- Domain stack uses Caddy on ports 80/443; stop the IP-only stack first to avoid port conflicts.
- After deploy, always verify:
  - `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://shiftplanner.wunderwerk.ai` (expect 200)
  - `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://shiftplanner.wunderwerk.ai/api/health` (expect 200)
- Before deploy, run `npm run build` locally to catch TypeScript build errors that unit/E2E tests may not cover.

## 14) IP-only Deployment (optional)
- Stack: `docker compose -f docker-compose.ip.yml up -d --build`
- Frontend: `http://46.224.114.183`
- Backend: `http://46.224.114.183:8000`
- IP-only stack binds port 80 directly; it conflicts with Caddy, so only run one stack at a time.
- `.env` required for domain setup:
  - `DOMAIN=shiftplanner.wunderwerk.ai`
  - `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=daniel.truhn@gmail.com`
  - `ADMIN_USERNAME=admin`
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=<prod password>`
  - `JWT_SECRET=<prod secret>`
  - `JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES=720` (avoid empty string)
- Caddy handles TLS + `/api` proxying. Frontend uses `VITE_API_URL=/api` so no extra env needed.
- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set in `docker-compose.yml` as `https://${DOMAIN}/api` (don’t leave it blank).
- If admin login fails after switching stacks, the existing DB user may still have the old password. Reset via:
  - `docker compose exec -T backend python - << 'PY' ...` (update `users` table in `/data/schedule.db`).
