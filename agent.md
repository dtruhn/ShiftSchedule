# agent.md — Weekly Schedule System (Current State)

This repo is a doctors/clinicians scheduling system with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend + OR-Tools solver. It is local-first and stores state in SQLite via the API.

---

## 1) Tech Stack
Frontend
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

Backend
- FastAPI + Uvicorn
- OR-Tools CP-SAT
- SQLite persistence (single JSON state row)

---

## 2) Core UI
Top bar
- Title, open slots badge, Settings button, avatar (top-right).
- Width aligned to the schedule card.

Schedule card
- Week navigator (prev/next, Today, date range) lives inside the card header.
- Today badge floats above the current day column header.
- Week starts Monday, weekend columns shaded.
- Control row between class rows and pool rows with icon buttons:
  - Only necessary, Distribute all, Reset to free (week and per day), with tooltips.

Rows
- Class rows (editable, reorderable priority): MRI, CT, Sonography, Conventional, On Call, etc.
- Pool rows (editable names, not deletable): Distribution Pool (id: pool-not-allocated), Vacation (id: pool-vacation).
- Pool rows appear below a separator line.
- Row labels are uppercase, no colored dots, truncate around 20 characters.

Cells
- Multiple clinician pills per cell, sorted by surname.
- Empty slots shown as red dashed pills based on min slots.
- Drag and drop is same-day only; other days grey out while dragging.
- Eligible target cells for a dragged clinician show a green border.
- Ineligible manual assignment is allowed, with a yellow warning icon.
- No eligible classes shows a red warning icon.
- Warning tooltips show only when hovering the icon itself.

Pills
- Compact blue pill, normal font weight.
- Warning icons are small circular badges at top-right of the pill.

---

## 3) Settings
Classes
- Reorder by drag handle to set priority.
- Rename, remove, add.
- Min slots split into weekday vs weekend/holiday.

Pools
- Rename pool rows (Distribution Pool, Vacation). No deletion.

Clinicians
- List with Add Clinician and Edit buttons.
- Editing uses the same modal as clicking a pill in the calendar.

Clinician Editor (modal)
- Eligible classes list is ordered. Drag to set priority (this order is also the preference list).
- Toggle to add/remove eligible classes.
- Vacation management with compact date inputs and a dash between start and end.
- Past vacations collapsed in a <details>.
- Modal body is scrollable for long vacation lists.

## 4) Data Model (Shared Concept)
```ts
type RowKind = "class" | "pool";

type WorkplaceRow = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  kind: RowKind;
  dotColorClass: string;
};

type VacationRange = { id: string; startISO: string; endISO: string };

type Clinician = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  qualifiedClassIds: string[];
  preferredClassIds: string[];
  vacations: VacationRange[];
};

type Assignment = {
  id: string;
  rowId: string;
  dateISO: string;
  clinicianId: string;
};

type MinSlotsByRowId = Record<string, { weekday: number; weekend: number }>;
```

---

## 5) Scheduling Logic (Frontend)
- Vacation override: for each date, if clinician is on vacation, they appear in Vacation pool and their class assignment is suppressed.
- Distribution Pool: any clinician not assigned to a class and not on vacation appears here.
- Assignments stored in a map (rowId + dateISO -> list of assignments).
- Drag and drop only within the same day.
- Cell click does nothing (no cell modal).

---

## 6) Solver (Backend, OR-Tools)
Endpoint: `POST /v1/solve`
Payload:
```json
{ "dateISO": "YYYY-MM-DD", "only_fill_required": true|false }
```

Behavior
- Uses only clinicians currently in Distribution Pool (unassigned and not on vacation).
- Hard constraints:
  - Qualification required.
  - Vacation overrides assignment.
  - Manual assignments remain in place; solver adds only from the pool.
- Objective:
  - Prioritize coverage by class order (top of class list is highest).
  - Minimize missing required slots.
  - If `only_fill_required=false`, add extras.
  - Preferred classes (order of eligible classes) is a lower-weight tie breaker.

---

## 7) Backend State + Persistence
Backend stores one JSON blob in SQLite:
```json
{
  "rows": [...],
  "clinicians": [...],
  "assignments": [...],
  "minSlotsByRowId": {...}
}
```
Table: `app_state` (single row id = "state").

Endpoints
- `GET /health`
- `GET /v1/state`
- `POST /v1/state`
- `POST /v1/solve`

---

## 8) Running Locally (Step-by-step)
Prereqs
- Python 3.9+
- Node 18+

Step 1: install backend deps
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

Step 2: install frontend deps
```bash
npm install
```

Step 3: start backend (Terminal 1)
```bash
python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host localhost --port 8000
```

Step 4: start frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
npm run dev -- --host localhost --port 5173
```

Step 5: open the app
- http://localhost:5173

If a port is already in use
- Backend: pick another port, then set `VITE_API_URL` for the frontend:
```bash
python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host localhost --port 8001
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8001 npm run dev -- --host localhost --port 5173
```
- Frontend: pick another port with `--port 5175` and open that URL in the browser.

If the UI says "Solver service is not responding"
- Check backend health: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Ensure `VITE_API_URL` matches the backend host/port.
- If using a non-localhost host (LAN or remote), set CORS explicitly:
```bash
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=http://my-host:5173 python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Stopping servers
- Press Ctrl+C in each terminal.

Deployment note
- Build the frontend with `VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.example.com npm run build`, then serve `dist/`.
- Run the backend behind a reverse proxy (or public host) and set `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` to your frontend origin.

Backend

## 10) Notes for New Agents
- The calendar is the source of truth for edits; Settings manages class priority + min slots + pool names + clinician list.
- Pool ids: Distribution Pool = `pool-not-allocated`, Vacation = `pool-vacation`.
- Keep drag restricted to same day.
- If you change the solver API, update `src/api/client.ts` and `WeeklySchedulePage.tsx`.
- Legacy row id `pool-not-working` is filtered out on load.
